# Renewed_Hope_Employment_Analysis
## Project Overview:
### This is a demonstration project using sample data from the 2025 Renewed Hope Employment Initiative of the National Directorate of Employment, NDE

## Data Source:
### The data used in this portfolio was generated from the structure of data collated from the renewed hope employment initiative of the NDE. It is not real and was created solely for illustrative and analytical purposes. It should not be referenced or used for official reporting, policy decisions, or any real-world application.

## tools Deployed:
* Ms Execel - Used for primary data collection and cleaning [Download Here](https://github.com/Giles720/Renewed_Hope_Employment_Analysis/blob/main/TRAINED.csv))
* Python for data Analysis and visualisation (Jupyter Notebook)

## Data Cleaning/Preparation:
* Data downloading from the Database
* data loading and inspection
* Removing Duplicates
* Standardize text capitalization
* Remove leading and trailing spaces
* Rmoving Incomplete records that are misleading and formating

## Exploratry Data Analysis (EDA):
 ### The EDA involes exploring the date to solve the following problem
   1.  What is the Gender Trend Across States?
   2.  Which State has the Most Female Participants?
   3.  Which State has the minimum Female Participants?
   4.  Calculate the Zonal Distribution.
   5.  Which age group has the highest trained participants?
   6.  Which scheme is in the highest demand?
   7.  What is the total number of participants documented?
   8.  What is the Total Participants?
   9.  Calculate the Marital distribution among trained participants,
   10. What is the Training status by percentage

# Data Analysis:
## Key Findings 
## 1. Gender Distribution Across States
### The gender participation analysis reveals diverse representation across states.
* States like Imo (12 females), Anambra (11), and Abia (9) recorded relatively higher female engagement.
* Conversely, states such as Kebbi (0 females), Kano (2), and Katsina (1) had significantly lower female representation.
* Overall, male participants consistently outnumbered females in most states, highlighting a gender gap in enrolment.

## 2. State with the Highest Number of Female Participants
* Contrary to expectations, Nasarawa, despite having only 1 female participant, was flagged due to a misinterpretation.
* A correction shows Imo State had the highest with 12 female participants.
  
## 3. Zonal Distribution of Participants
* Participation was fairly distributed, with the North West (114 participants) and North Central (110) leading.
* The South East recorded the lowest engagement with 75 participants.

## 4. Age Group with the Highest Number of Trained Participants
* The 16–25 years category dominated the training program, accounting for 237 participants, emphasizing youth engagement.

## 5. Most Demanded Training Scheme
* The Community-Based Training Scheme (CBTS) is the most sought-after, with 96 participants, which indicates community-level interest and accessibility.
## 6. Total Number of Documented Participants
* A total of 523 participants were documented
## 7. Total Number of Participants Recorded
* The full dataset comprises 567 Participants
## 8. Marital Status Distribution among Trained Participants
* A majority of trained individuals were married (322), followed by singles (85).
* Minimal representations are widowed (4) and divorced (2) participants.
## 9.  Training Status by Percentage
* Approximately 73% were documented individuals completed training.
* The remaining 27% were recorded as not trained, signalling areas for follow-up or support.

# Actionable Insights:

 * Boost women’s enrollment in Kebbi, Katsina, and Kano by launching targeted outreach campaigns in low-female-participating states.
*  Partner with women-centric NGOS and other stakeholders to fully address the gender gap.
*  Amplify mentorship for participants aged 16-25.
*  Incorporate youth interests and global employment opportunities by adding technology and digital skill education.
*  Ensure adequate resource distribution and mobilisation in areas such as the South East, where participation is minimal, to achieve balanced representation.
*  Perform zonal assessments to design training programs that meet local economic priorities.
*  Understand and mitigate the barriers (logistics, awareness, timing) for the 27% who were not trained. 
*  Explore remote or hybrid training approaches to increase access for constrained participants. 
*  Train NDE field officers on data and digital tool usage at regular intervals.
*  Increase funding for CBTS, the scheme delivering the highest demand.
*  Build an interactive dashboard to enable monitoring of state-wise demands in real time by gender and age group.

# Conclusion:
## The analysis reveals strong youth participation and a high demand for community-based training, but also highlights gender and regional disparities. To enhance impact, the program should focus on inclusive outreach, data quality improvement, and expansion of high-performing schemes like CBTS.
